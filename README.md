# WebAPIIdentity
Server for final project

This server is made with ASP .NET 5 API with Entety Framework and Identity with JWT authentication.

I use many to many relationships between category and product as well as between category objects themself.

Websocket is also implemmented for the chat function and the multiplayer yatzy.

There is also added support for email verification.
